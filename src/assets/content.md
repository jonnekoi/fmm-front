- **League Guesser**

\
Welcome to the ultimate competitive guessing platform! This app allows users to join leagues, compete against each other, and climb to the top by accumulating points. Whether you're joining a public league or creating your own private league, the goal is clear: prove you're the best league guesser.

- **Join a League**:
---
- You can either join a public league by selecting one from the list and signing up, or you can join a private league by entering a specific league code that a friend or the league owner shares with you.
---
- **Compete and Gain Points**: 
---
- Once you're part of a league, you'll participate in various guessing challenges. Each correct guess earns you points, and your goal is to outsmart others and rise through the rankings to claim victory as the top guesser in your league.
---
- **Leagues with Specific Bets**:
---
- League owners have the ability to add specific challenges or "bets" to the league. These bets are unique guessing challenges that can add excitement and further opportunities to score points.
---
- **League Duration**:
---
- Every league has a set duration, so be sure to keep track of the leagueâ€™s time frame. After the duration ends, the player with the highest points takes home the crown of the best guesser.
